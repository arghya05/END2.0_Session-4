# END2.0_Session-4

Assignment
Assignment:

Refer to the 04_LSTM_IMDB _Sentiment we wrote in the class: Rewrite this code, but this time remove RNN and add LSTM.

Refer to this 04_LSTM_Quiz file.

The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz.

Please note that the Session 4 Assignment Solution will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers.
